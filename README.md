# CS260, Home of my CS260 project - Gym Bro Buddy

## Elevator Pitch

- Have you ever wanted to remember what your best bench was? Do you want to physically see the progress that you make in the gym? Want to brag to your friends about those massive winter gains or the summer cut? With the absolute dullest blade technology I could find I present to you the Gym Bro Buddy<sup>Â©</sup> it will keep track of your stats, make you training plans, calculate your ORM and almost nothing else! What a steal!

## Requirements
### Authentication:
- Users will have to login using email and password in order to access everything and this account will be tied to them and their stats
- Login and Sign up will send different API calls to express and express will keep a local copy of stuff (eventually it will be done in mongo DB), and it will send you to the right page now logged in
### Database data:
- I'm going to track the data of the user for their gym stats and graph it visually for them. They can see their progress from numbers pulled from mongo DB that I will maintain.
- For now I think I'm goiong to have it on express
### WebSocket data: 
- This will be pulling the most recent data and being able to share stats with friends. Everyone wants to show off to friends, or if you just want to see where your at so you would be able to pull up live time feed and see how its going for them

##UpdateLog
### Javascript
- Every page has a "template" that it pulls from in order to modify the background, header, and footer consistently.
- The header buttons will direct you to those pages
- The settings have some local storage that allows you to change your display name
- The trackstats now have a couple buttons, add lift which creates a modal for you to add in your lift, which is set to the service, view button, which will show you your last 10 lifts (to eventually be overriden by node.js actual graphing)
### Service
- Updated everything to be in the public folder
- The main "host" is now the index.js which allows for everything else
- Now using Express
-  Added in two endpoints that allow you to post to workouts (which is implementsed in trackstats.js) and get the workouts. 
### Html, Css
- You can look at the webpage to see what it does
- Css is all done by hand / no bootstrap because I hate myself


## Idea List / TODO
- Holdiay web pages
- Predict stats from other stats?
- The actual Node.js tracker and grapher
- The send message thing
- Clear your data from settings
