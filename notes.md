This is where my notes are going to be.

Created an IP address for my website. Couldn't figure out how to make it elastic so that might be a problem for future me

Used Routes 53 to register a domain name to my ip. If I ever cahnge the IP on accident I need to go back here to alter the records

Used the Caddy file in the ssh and just replaced it with my domain. The innerworkings are a mystery but I can now get an https certification
